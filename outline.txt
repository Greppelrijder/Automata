The Grid function will be doing most of the work. We need to implement the following features:
* any amount of possible cell states - this is relatively easy, we represent cells their by state as an integer
* any amount of dimensions - we need to support at least 1d and 2d grids, because both the 1d CA and the 2d CA need to derive from this class. To generalise this properly, any amount of dimensions should be allowed (otherwise we're basically hacking two different child classes into one parent class, which is bad use of OOP)
* any amount of neighbour cells - this will be one of the biggest challanges. Our program needs to be extremely flexible in this regard. For example, in a 1d grid, it should be an option to let each cell have 3 neighbours. This would mean that, for example, the cell to the left and the two cells to the right of a particular cell are considerd its neighbours. On the other hand, 8 neighbours in a 2d-grid would mean: each cell has the ring around it as its neighbours. If we would instead want each cell to have 10 neighbours, then two extra neighbours outside the ring should be assigned. We need to design a neighbour-assigningsystem that is constistant across dimensions
* custom rulesets - this shouldn't be too hard but it won't be trivial either. We'll use the rule system described in the assignment: the neighbourhood of a cell is the integer concatenation of the states of the particular cell and its neighbours. Again, we need to implement a consistant order for this. A 'ruleset' is a map from each possible neighbourhood to the corresponding new state. This way, a ruleset can be represented by a single integer. The system will be further complicated by the fact that more than two states are allowed. Ordering the different neighbourhoods will be more challenging.
* different boundry conditions - we need to implement at least the three boundry rules described in the assignment. This won't be that hard for a specific case like 1d or 2d, but we need to generalize it to any amount of dimensions (probably working with multi-dimensional arrays)


Deriving the CA_1D and CA_2D class should be easy after we designed the Grid class properly

Finally, we need to add some visual functionality to the CA_1D and CA_2D classes. We're not sure what package to use as pygame is not supported currently. However, the visual layer is independend of the inner functionality of the program, so we won't need to worry about this part until later.
